Persuasive Advice for Senior Management: the Three C’s

You are the analyst whom Senior Management named to the 2016 strategic team.
While collaborators and Management may not appreciate the technical foundations for your conclusions,
how can you nevertheless persuade them to see the value in your message?
Persuasive analysts use analytical tools that help them deliver advice with three C’s:
Context, Confidence, and Clarity.

For decades, spreadsheets have been the insurance analytical tool of choice
primarily because they can prototype models relatively quickly (high Context).
But spreadsheets can be difficult to tech-check and audit (low Confidence)
and time-consuming to modify for refocused objectives (low Clarity).
More recently, R and derivative products are evolving into a computing tool
that is particularly well-honed to deliver Three-C analytical advice to insurance Senior Management.
